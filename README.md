# nodejs-loopback-scaffold

This project is originally generated using `lb4` command from `@loopback/cli`. See [Getting started with LoopBack 4](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Getting-started.html) for more details.

It has been slightly tailored as a template for `appsody`.

It also includes a JAM stack application using Gridsome.

To run the rest server
Appsody run

To run the gridsome app (in other window)
cd gridsome/todolist
gridsome develop

The code is hardcoded to use a server named mint20-loopback4 running on 8080

This is a play project
